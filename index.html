                    <p>
                      My Name is Priti Dhungel Bhandary and I have been a living in
                      Wellington, Florida since Dec 2020. In the past I have been an
                      active member of INLS Florida chapter and represented WPB
                      Pathshala as a Coordinator for 5 yrs. I have also been an active
                      member of Nepali community in Florida through different
                      organizations. I was a member of FNA and was actively involved
                      in that association for fund raiser and cultural programs. Being
                      part of the Nepali community for over 20 years, I understand the
                      growth the community has seen and where NAF needs to be in next
                      20 years. Of course, this takes organization and proper funding.
                      And as a treasurer that would be the center of my
                      responsibility. I believe NAF is a collective union of leaders
                      and the executive committee needs to work as a group to fulfill
                      the goals written in the by-laws. Having a diverse group in the
                      executive committee will only propel us for future growth and
                      involvement in our community. One of my goals is to make sure
                      that all Nepalese and friends of Nepal in Florida is represented
                      equally in NAF. Our strategy should involve leaders from the
                      different parts of Florida that have the same commitment to NAF
                      as their local Nepali organizations. We as an organization, must
                      understand what their needs and expectations are for NAF. Once
                      that is established, we can all grow and prosper together. As a
                      treasurer I would like to make sure we have a strong financial
                      foundation to implement the programs that we would like to
                      establish in the future.
